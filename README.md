# DoneList 🚀

**DoneList** is a minimalist Progressive Web App (PWA) crafted with a strict Apple-inspired aesthetic. It's not just a log—it's a psychological tool designed to help you overcome "achievement amnesia" and build lasting discipline through the celebration of daily victories.

## 🧠 Why DoneList?

Most of us suffer from **achievement amnesia**. At the end of the day, we remember exactly which three emails we didn't answer, but we completely ignore the ten things we actually solved. DoneList "hacks" your psychology:

- **Fight Negative Bias:** Our brains are wired to notice threats and unfinished tasks. DoneList acts as a counterbalance, forcing you to acknowledge real progress.
- **Dopamine on Demand:** Unlike To-Do lists where the feeling disappears when you delete a task, DoneList builds an archive of victories you can return to anytime.
- **Objective Productivity:** Change the feeling of "I did nothing today" into clear facts. See exactly where your energy is really going.
- **Fuel for Hard Days:** Your archive is proof that you are capable of getting things done, even when you don't feel like it.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Activity Heatmap:** A GitHub-style year-long visualization of your consistency, glowing with your chosen accent color.
- **Dynamic Themes:** Choose from Apple-inspired accent colors (Orange, Blue, Purple, Green, Pink, Indigo) that tint the entire UI, including backgrounds and status bars.
- **iOS Swipe-to-Delete:** Native feel when removing items—swipe left to reveal a delete action, just like on iOS.
- **Streaks 🔥 & Milestones:** Track your daily consistency with celebratory confetti bursts at key milestones (7, 30, 100 days).
- **Haptic Feedback:** Subtle vibrations on interaction for a physical, tactile device feel.
- **PWA Optimized:** Specially tuned for iPhone "Add to Home Screen" mode, including a dedicated login flow.
