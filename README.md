# DoneList 🚀

**DoneList** is a minimalist Progressive Web App (PWA) crafted with a strict Apple-inspired aesthetic. It's not just a log—it's a psychological tool designed to help you overcome "achievement amnesia" and build lasting discipline through the celebration of daily victories.

## 🧠 Why DoneList?

Most of us suffer from **achievement amnesia**. At the end of the day, we remember exactly which three emails we didn't answer, but we completely ignore the ten things we actually solved. DoneList "hacks" your psychology:

- **Fight Negative Bias:** Our brains are wired to notice threats and unfinished tasks. DoneList acts as a counterbalance, forcing you to acknowledge real progress.
- **Dopamine on Demand:** Unlike To-Do lists where the feeling disappears when you delete a task, DoneList builds an archive of victories you can return to anytime.
- **Objective Productivity:** Change the feeling of "I did nothing today" into clear facts. See exactly where your energy is really going.
- **Fuel for Hard Days:** Your archive is proof that you are capable of getting things done, even when you don't feel like it.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Hierarchical Reflections:** Daily, weekly, and monthly rituals to crown your best moments—from **🌟 Daily Stars** to **💎 Weekly Jewels** and **🏆 Monthly Trophies**.
